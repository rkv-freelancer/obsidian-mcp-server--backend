## Tools

Fourteen tools grouped by shape — readers fetch notes and metadata, writers create or surgically edit content, managers reconcile tags and frontmatter, and a guarded escape hatch dispatches Obsidian command-palette commands.

| Tool Name | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| `obsidian_get_note` | Read a note as raw content, full structured form (content + frontmatter + tags + stat, with optional outgoing links), structural document map, or a single section. |
| `obsidian_list_notes` | List notes and subdirectories under a vault path. Recursive walk (default depth 2, max depth 20; 1000-entry cap) with optional `extension` and `nameRegex` filters. |
| `obsidian_list_tags` | List every tag found across the vault with usage counts, including hierarchical parents. Optional `nameRegex` post-filters the result set. |
| `obsidian_list_commands` | List Obsidian command-palette commands, optionally filtered by `nameRegex` on display name. **Opt-in via `OBSIDIAN_ENABLE_COMMANDS=true`** (paired with `obsidian_execute_command`). |
| `obsidian_search_notes` | Search the vault by text, JSONLogic, or BM25-ranked Omnisearch (when the plugin is reachable). Results paginate via opaque cursors. |
| `obsidian_write_note` | Create a note, replace a single section in place, or — with `overwrite: true` — clobber an existing file. Refuses whole-file writes against an existing path by default. |
| `obsidian_append_to_note` | Append content to a note. Without `section`, creates the file if missing. With `section`, appends to a specific heading, block, or frontmatter field (file must exist). |
| `obsidian_patch_note` | Surgical `append` / `prepend` / `replace` against a heading, block reference, or frontmatter field. |
| `obsidian_replace_in_note` | Body-wide search-replace inside a single note. Literal or regex matching with whole-word, whitespace-flexible, and case-sensitivity options; supports capture-group replacement. |
| `obsidian_manage_frontmatter` | Atomic `get` / `set` / `delete` on a single frontmatter key. |
| `obsidian_manage_tags` | Add, remove, or list tags. Defaults to the frontmatter `tags:` array; `location: 'inline'` or `'both'` opts into mutating the note body. |
| `obsidian_delete_note` | Permanently delete a note. Elicits human confirmation when the client supports it. |
| `obsidian_open_in_ui` | Open a file in the Obsidian app UI, with `failIfMissing` and `newLeaf` toggles. |
| `obsidian_execute_command` | Execute an Obsidian command-palette command by ID. **Opt-in via `OBSIDIAN_ENABLE_COMMANDS=true`.** |

### `obsidian_get_note`

Read a note in one of four projections, addressed by vault path, the active file, or a periodic note (`daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `quarterly`, `yearly`).

- `format: "content"` — raw markdown body
- `format: "full"` — content, frontmatter, tags, and file metadata; pass `includeLinks: true` to also parse outgoing wiki and markdown link references from the body (vault-internal only — external URLs are filtered)
- `format: "document-map"` — catalog of headings, block references, and frontmatter fields
- `format: "section"` — single heading/block/frontmatter section value (requires `section`); heading sections include the full subtree under that heading

Pair the document-map projection with `obsidian_patch_note` to discover edit targets before patching.

---

### `obsidian_search_notes`

Up to three search modes selected by `mode`:

- `text` — substring match with surrounding context windows. `contextLength` controls characters of context per side of each match (default 100; bump it for more context per hit). Optional `pathPrefix` filter (text mode only — passing `pathPrefix` in any other mode is rejected with `path_prefix_invalid_mode`).
- `jsonlogic` — JSONLogic tree evaluated against `path`, `content`, `frontmatter.<key>`, `tags`, and `stat.{ctime,mtime,size}`; custom `glob` and `regexp` operators
- `omnisearch` — BM25-ranked search via the community [Omnisearch](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-omnisearch) plugin. Supports quoted phrases, `-exclusion`, `path:` / `ext:` filters, typo tolerance, and PDF + OCR coverage (via [Text Extractor](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-text-extractor)). Only present in the mode enum when the plugin's HTTP server is reachable at startup; the upstream hard-caps results at 50 — narrow the query to surface more (the response carries `truncated: true` when the cap was likely hit).

Results paginate via opaque cursors per the [MCP 2025-06-18 spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/utils/pagination): omit `cursor` for the first page, then pass `nextCursor` from the prior response. Every result carries `totalCount` (post-path-policy, pre-pagination); `nextCursor` is omitted on the last page. Text-mode hits are additionally clipped per file at `maxMatchesPerHit` (default 10) so a single match-heavy note can't blow the response budget — clipped hits carry `truncated: true` and `totalMatches`.

---

### `obsidian_write_note`

Create or surgically replace, with a protective default against accidental whole-file overwrites.

- Without `section` — full-file `PUT`. **Refuses to clobber an existing file** unless `overwrite: true` is set. The `file_exists` (`Conflict`) error suggests `obsidian_patch_note` / `obsidian_append_to_note` / `obsidian_replace_in_note` for in-place edits.
- With `section` — `PATCH`-with-replace against the named heading/block/frontmatter field, leaving the rest of the file untouched. The `overwrite` flag is ignored in section mode.

The output reports `created: true` when the call brought a new file into existence; `false` when it replaced an existing one or targeted a section. Every mutating tool also returns `previousSizeInBytes` and `currentSizeInBytes` so an agent can spot accidental clobbers, unexpected upstream behavior, or a typo path that landed at the wrong file.

---

### `obsidian_append_to_note`

A combined upsert + section-append primitive that mirrors the upstream Local REST API behavior:

- Without `section` — `POST` to `/vault/{path}`. Appends when the file exists, **creates the file with your content as the entire body when it doesn't.** The output's `created: true` flags the second branch so the agent can notice when a typo path or a not-yet-created daily note silently turned into a brand-new file.
- With `section` — `PATCH`-with-append against the named heading, block reference, or frontmatter field. The file must exist (PATCH preflight throws `note_missing` otherwise). Pass `createTargetIfMissing: true` to bring the section itself into existence inside an existing file. Block-reference targets concatenate adjacent to the block line without a separator — include a leading newline in `content` if you want one.

`previousSizeInBytes` is `0` on the upsert-create branch and the actual file size otherwise; `currentSizeInBytes` is the post-write size read from the upstream after the operation. Compare deltas against `Buffer.byteLength(content)` to detect auto-newline injection or concurrent writers.

---

### `obsidian_patch_note`

Surgical edits at a single document target.

- `operation: "append"` adds after the section
- `operation: "prepend"` adds before the section
- `operation: "replace"` swaps it out
- Targets: heading path, block reference ID, or frontmatter field

Use `obsidian_get_note` with `format: "document-map"` to discover what targets exist before patching.

---

### `obsidian_replace_in_note`

Body-wide search-replace for edits that don't fit `obsidian_patch_note`'s structural targets. The note is fetched, replacements are applied sequentially (each sees the previous output), and the result is written back in a single `PUT`.

Per-replacement options:

- `useRegex` — treat `search` as an ECMAScript regex. With `useRegex: true`, the replacement honors `$1` / `$&` capture-group references.
- `caseSensitive` — when `false`, match case-insensitively
- `wholeWord` — wrap the pattern in `\b…\b`; works in both literal and regex modes
- `flexibleWhitespace` — substitute any run of whitespace in `search` with `\s+`. Literal mode only — has no effect when `useRegex: true` (express it directly).
- `replaceAll` — when `false`, only the first match is replaced

Literal mode preserves `$1` / `$&` in the replacement verbatim — only `useRegex: true` expands capture-group references.

---

### `obsidian_manage_tags`

Add, remove, or list tags on a note. Operates on one of two representations, defaulting to the canonical Obsidian frontmatter location:

- `location: 'frontmatter'` (default) — only the frontmatter `tags:` array; the note body is left untouched
- `location: 'inline'` — only inline `#tag` syntax in the body; `add` appends `#tag` at end-of-file
- `location: 'both'` — opt-in reconciliation across both representations

`add` ensures the tag is present in the requested location(s); `remove` strips it; `list` ignores the input `tags` array. Inline `#tag` occurrences inside fenced code blocks are intentionally left alone.

---

### `obsidian_delete_note`

Permanently delete a note. When the client supports `elicit`, the server requests human confirmation before issuing the `DELETE` and the prompt includes the file's byte size — destructive blast radius visible before the user confirms. Without elicitation, the `destructiveHint` annotation surfaces the operation in the host's approval flow. The output reports `previousSizeInBytes` (size at the moment of deletion) and `currentSizeInBytes: 0`.

---

### `obsidian_execute_command`

Dispatch an Obsidian command-palette command by ID (discoverable via `obsidian_list_commands`). Behavior is command-dependent — some commands open UI, others delete files or close the vault.

**Off by default.** When `OBSIDIAN_ENABLE_COMMANDS` is unset, both `obsidian_execute_command` and its discovery partner `obsidian_list_commands` are wrapped with `disabledTool()` — absent from `tools/list` (the LLM can't invoke them) but still visible in the operator-facing manifest with a hint to enable them.

---

## Path policy (folder-scoped permissions)

Three optional env vars gate which vault paths each tool can target. **Default unset = full vault** for both reads and writes — backwards compatible.

| Goal | Config |
|:---|:---|
| Default (current behavior) | all unset |
| Read everywhere, write only in `projects/` and `scratch/` | `OBSIDIAN_WRITE_PATHS=projects/,scratch/` |
| Read only `public/`, write only `public/inbox/` | `OBSIDIAN_READ_PATHS=public/`, `OBSIDIAN_WRITE_PATHS=public/inbox/` |
| Read-only deployment — no writes anywhere | `OBSIDIAN_READ_ONLY=true` |

**Matching is prefix-based with implicit recursion**, case-insensitive, with trailing slashes normalized. `projects/` matches `projects/a.md`, `projects/sub/b.md`, etc.

**Write paths are implicitly readable** — you can't sanely edit what you can't see. So a read passes when the target matches `READ_PATHS` *or* `WRITE_PATHS`.

**`OBSIDIAN_READ_ONLY=true` short-circuits before the path checks** — every write tool and the command-palette pair are wrapped with `disabledTool()` at startup (absent from `tools/list`), and any write that still reaches the service is denied at runtime regardless of `WRITE_PATHS`.

Denies are typed `path_forbidden` (JSON-RPC code `Forbidden`) with the active scope echoed back in `data.recovery.hint` and `data.activeScope`, so the LLM can self-correct without inspecting server logs. Search results from `obsidian_search_notes` are filtered against `READ_PATHS` silently — surfacing a "we hid N hits" indicator would defeat the gate.

The startup banner logs the active scope so operators can verify their config at boot.

---

## Resources

| Type | URI | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Resource | `obsidian://vault/{+path}` | A note in the vault — content, frontmatter, tags, and file metadata. |
| Resource | `obsidian://tags` | All tags found across the vault, with usage counts. |
| Resource | `obsidian://status` | Server reachability, auth status, plugin/Obsidian version info, and the plugin manifest. |

All resource data is also reachable via tools — `obsidian_get_note` for `obsidian://vault/{+path}`, `obsidian_list_tags` for `obsidian://tags`. Resources exist for clients that prefer attaching a specific note or vault snapshot to a conversation.

## Features

Built on [`@cyanheads/mcp-ts-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cyanheads/mcp-ts-core):

- Declarative tool and resource definitions — single file per primitive, framework handles registration and validation
- Unified error handling — handlers throw, framework catches, classifies, and formats. Tools advertise their failure surface via typed `errors[]` contracts.
- Server-level `instructions` on `initialize` — surfaces deployment-specific orientation (active path policy, read-only mode, command-palette toggle) to spec-compliant clients alongside the static tool/resource catalog
- Pluggable auth on the HTTP transport: `none`, `jwt`, `oauth`
- Structured logging with optional OpenTelemetry tracing
- STDIO and Streamable HTTP transports

The server itself is stateless — every tool call hits the Local REST API directly. The framework's storage backends, request-state KV, and progress streams aren't used here; Obsidian is single-vault and there's nothing to persist between calls.

Obsidian-specific:

- Wraps the [Obsidian Local REST API](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api) plugin — typed client, deterministic error mapping
- Section-aware editing across headings, block references, and frontmatter fields via `PATCH`-with-target operations
- Tag reconciliation across both representations: frontmatter `tags:` array and inline `#tag` syntax (skipping fenced code blocks)
- Search across up to three modes: text, JSONLogic, and (when the plugin is reachable) BM25-ranked Omnisearch — cursor-paginated per the MCP 2025-06-18 spec, with per-file match clipping in text mode
- Optional human-in-the-loop confirmation for destructive deletes via `ctx.elicit`
- Folder-scoped read/write permissions via `OBSIDIAN_READ_PATHS` / `OBSIDIAN_WRITE_PATHS` and a global `OBSIDIAN_READ_ONLY` kill switch — denies are typed `path_forbidden` with the active scope echoed back in the error data
- Opt-in command-palette pair (`obsidian_list_commands` + `obsidian_execute_command`) — registered only when `OBSIDIAN_ENABLE_COMMANDS=true`
- Forgiving path resolution on `obsidian_get_note` and `obsidian_open_in_ui` — silently retries case-mismatched paths against the canonical filename, throws `Conflict` on ambiguous case matches, and enriches `NotFound` with `Did you mean: …?` suggestions when only near-matches exist. `obsidian_delete_note` is deliberately excluded — a destructive op shouldn't silently rewrite the target path.

## Getting started

Add the following to your MCP client configuration file. The Obsidian Local REST API plugin must be installed and enabled in your vault — see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["obsidian-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE": "stdio",
        "MCP_LOG_LEVEL": "info",
        "OBSIDIAN_API_KEY": "your-local-rest-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or with npx (no Bun required):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "obsidian-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE": "stdio",
        "MCP_LOG_LEVEL": "info",
        "OBSIDIAN_API_KEY": "your-local-rest-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Streamable HTTP, set the transport and start the server. Inline env vars work for one-off runs; for repeated use, copy values into `.env` (see [`.env.example`](./.env.example)) and run `bun run start:http`.

```sh
MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=http OBSIDIAN_API_KEY=... bun run start:http
# Server listens at http://127.0.0.1:3010/mcp by default
```

### Prerequisites

- [Bun v1.3.11](https://bun.sh/) or higher (or Node.js v24+).
- The [Obsidian Local REST API](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api) plugin **v4.0.0 or later** installed and enabled in your vault. Generate an API key in **Settings → Community Plugins → Local REST API** and copy it into `OBSIDIAN_API_KEY`.
- This server defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:27123` for simplicity. Enable **"Non-encrypted (HTTP) Server"** in the plugin settings to use it. To use the always-on HTTPS port instead, set `OBSIDIAN_BASE_URL=https://127.0.0.1:27124`; the plugin's self-signed cert is handled by `OBSIDIAN_VERIFY_SSL=false` (the default).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/cyanheads/obsidian-mcp-server.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the directory:**

   ```sh
   cd obsidian-mcp-server
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   bun install
   ```

4. **Configure environment:**

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   # edit .env and set OBSIDIAN_API_KEY
   ```

## Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default |
|:---------|:------------|:--------|
| `OBSIDIAN_API_KEY` | **Required.** Bearer token for the Obsidian Local REST API plugin. | — |
| `OBSIDIAN_BASE_URL` | Base URL of the Local REST API plugin. Use `https://127.0.0.1:27124` for the always-on HTTPS port (self-signed cert). | `http://127.0.0.1:27123` |
| `OBSIDIAN_VERIFY_SSL` | Verify the TLS certificate. Default `false` because the plugin uses a self-signed cert. On Node, the dispatcher's `rejectUnauthorized` option handles this without any process-wide change. On Bun, the runtime ignores that option, so the service additionally sets `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` — that fallback is scoped to Bun only. | `false` |
| `OBSIDIAN_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | Per-request timeout in milliseconds. | `30000` |
| `OBSIDIAN_ENABLE_COMMANDS` | Opt-in flag for the command-palette pair (`obsidian_list_commands` + `obsidian_execute_command`). Off by default — Obsidian commands are opaque and can be destructive. | `false` |
| `OBSIDIAN_READ_PATHS` | Comma-separated vault-relative folder allowlist for read operations. Prefix-based with implicit recursion; case-insensitive; trailing slashes normalized. Unset = full vault. Write paths are implicitly readable. | unset |
| `OBSIDIAN_WRITE_PATHS` | Comma-separated vault-relative folder allowlist for write operations. Same syntax as `OBSIDIAN_READ_PATHS`. Unset = full vault. | unset |
| `OBSIDIAN_READ_ONLY` | Global kill switch. When `true`, denies every write regardless of `OBSIDIAN_WRITE_PATHS`, and suppresses the `OBSIDIAN_ENABLE_COMMANDS` pair (commands can mutate). | `false` |
| `OBSIDIAN_OMNISEARCH_URL` | Override URL for the [Omnisearch](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-omnisearch) plugin's HTTP server. When unset, derives from `OBSIDIAN_BASE_URL` host with port `51361` (falling back to `http://localhost:51361`). Probed once at startup — if reachable, the `omnisearch` mode is added to `obsidian_search_notes`; otherwise it's omitted from the tool schema. Restart the server to re-probe. | derived |
| `MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE` | Transport: `stdio` or `http`. | `stdio` |
| `MCP_HTTP_HOST` | Host for the HTTP server. | `127.0.0.1` |
| `MCP_HTTP_PORT` | Port for the HTTP server. | `3010` |
| `MCP_HTTP_ENDPOINT_PATH` | Endpoint path for the JSON-RPC handler. | `/mcp` |
| `MCP_PUBLIC_URL` | Public origin override for TLS-terminating reverse-proxy deployments (landing page, Server Card, RFC 9728 metadata). | unset |
| `MCP_AUTH_MODE` | Auth mode: `none`, `jwt`, or `oauth`. | `none` |
| `MCP_AUTH_SECRET_KEY` | **Required when `MCP_AUTH_MODE=jwt`.** ≥32-char shared secret used to verify incoming JWTs. | — |
| `MCP_AUTH_DISABLE_SCOPE_CHECKS` | When `true`, bypasses per-tool scope enforcement after the auth-context presence check. Token signature, audience, issuer, and expiry validation remain intact. Use only when a custom claim can't be injected and combine with `OBSIDIAN_READ_PATHS` / `OBSIDIAN_WRITE_PATHS` / `OBSIDIAN_READ_ONLY` for access control. A `WARNING` is logged at startup whenever the bypass is active. | `false` |
| `MCP_LOG_LEVEL` | Log level (RFC 5424). | `info` |
| `LOGS_DIR` | Directory for log files (Node.js only). | `<project-root>/logs` |
| `OTEL_ENABLED` | Enable [OpenTelemetry instrumentation](https://github.com/cyanheads/mcp-ts-core/tree/main/docs/telemetry) (spans, metrics, completion logs). | `false` |

See [`.env.example`](./.env.example) for the full list of optional overrides.

## Running the server

### Local development

- **Build and run the production version:**

  ```sh
  # One-time build
  bun run rebuild

  # Run the built server
  bun run start:stdio
  # or
  bun run start:http
  ```

- **Run checks and tests:**

  ```sh
  bun run devcheck   # Lint, format, typecheck, security, changelog sync
  bun run test       # Vitest test suite
  bun run lint:mcp   # Validate MCP definitions against spec
  ```

### Docker

```sh
docker build -t obsidian-mcp-server .
docker run --rm -e OBSIDIAN_API_KEY=your-key -p 3010:3010 obsidian-mcp-server
```

The Dockerfile defaults to HTTP transport, stateless session mode, and logs to `/var/log/obsidian-mcp-server`. OpenTelemetry peer dependencies are installed by default — build with `--build-arg OTEL_ENABLED=false` to omit them.

The image binds to `0.0.0.0` inside the container (required for Docker port mapping). For any deployment reachable beyond your own machine, set `MCP_AUTH_MODE=jwt` (with `MCP_AUTH_SECRET_KEY`) or `oauth` — otherwise the listener forwards your `OBSIDIAN_API_KEY` to the vault on behalf of every caller.

## Project structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|:----------|:--------|
| `src/index.ts` | `createApp()` entry point — registers tools/resources and inits the Obsidian service. |
| `src/config` | Server-specific environment variable parsing (`OBSIDIAN_*`) with Zod. |
| `src/services/obsidian` | Local REST API client, frontmatter operations, section extractor, domain types. |
| `src/mcp-server/tools` | Tool definitions (`*.tool.ts`) and shared input schemas. |
| `src/mcp-server/resources` | Resource definitions (`*.resource.ts`). |
| `src/mcp-server/prompts` | Prompt definitions (currently empty — CRUD/search shape doesn't benefit from a structured template). |
| `tests/` | Vitest tests mirroring `src/`. |
| `docs/` | Upstream OpenAPI spec for the Local REST API plugin and the generated `tree.md`. |
| `changelog/` | Per-version release notes; `CHANGELOG.md` is the regenerated rollup. |

## Development guide

See [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) for development guidelines and architectural rules. The short version:

- Handlers throw, framework catches — no `try/catch` in tool logic
- Use `ctx.log` for request-scoped logging, `ctx.state` for tenant-scoped storage
- Register new tools and resources via the barrels in `src/mcp-server/*/definitions/index.ts`
- Wrap external API calls: validate raw → normalize to domain type → return output schema; never fabricate missing fields
